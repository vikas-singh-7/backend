so we know that in js what we do to import and export the thingf rom one js file to anotehr js 

we do export{variable,variable2} 

and to import we do import {variable,variable2} from "./script2.js"

but it wont work in node 

in node when we want to import something from a file we use require('pathofFile') function 

to export what we do is , we use module.exports=variables

module object ki export property use krke usme assign krdo values jo apko export krni hai :p
