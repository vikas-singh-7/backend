why we need ejs , what the duck is ejs .
well ejs (embeded javascript)  is a template engine ,,,
wow wow ow what the horse is template engine is ?
well template engine is something which generate a special kind of html which can dynamivally cahnges ,
what does it means ?
well we know html is a static langage , it will print the samw stuff which is written in it , and for all the users who ever ill open this html they will get the same content
now template engines aloows us to generte a html (speecial HTML )  which can show things df on df users 

and ejs is one of the template engine it takes a html and convert it into a ejs so that html will show data dynamically , 


steps ::

first install ejs npm i ejs


configure it ::   configure the template engine 

app.set("view engine","ejs")   // use this code 

app.set("view engine","ejs")



make a views folder 

views > make a ejs file remember not a html file , ejs file 
why , becasue we have to change the content of html dynamically thast why ejs file :P

well by just doing app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
    res.redner("filename")   dont use any extension here 
})
